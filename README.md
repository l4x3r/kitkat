This is a sample app for showing how to use Docker to migrate from LocalDB (SQL Express) to a fully fledged SQL Server.
I will also showcase GitHub Codespaces, Entity Framework Migrations.

Disclaimer: The app lacks serious errorhandling and unittesting. Also its sadly not sponsored in any way by KitKat or Nestle :/
